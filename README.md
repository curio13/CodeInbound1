# Customer Survey App

This project is a simple customer survey application built using React. The app allows users to rate various aspects of a service or product and provides an easy way to navigate through the survey questions. The survey responses are saved in local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Features

- **Questionnaire**: The survey contains different types of questions, including rating scales (1-5, 1-10) and text input for feedback.
- **Local Storage**: The user's responses are saved to local storage, ensuring that their progress is maintained even after a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate between questions using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, which remain fixed in position to ensure a consistent user experience.
